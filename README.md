# Continuous Integration Java Project with Jenkins

## Tools Used
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Code Commit:** Git
- **Version Control System:** GitHub
- **Continuous Integration Server:** Jenkins
- **Code Analysis:** Checkmate with SonarQube Scanner Plugin
- **Code Analysis Report:** SonarQube Server
- **Code Build:** Maven
- **Artifact Repository Server:** Nexus
- **Notification:** Slack
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2 Server)

## Flow of Execution

1. **Code Changes:**
   - Developers make code changes and commit them via Git to the GitHub repository.

2. **Jenkins Trigger:**
   - Jenkins, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, monitors the GitHub repository for changes.
   - When changes are detected, Jenkins initiates the continuous integration process.

3. **Unit Testing:**
   - Jenkins starts with unit tests using JUnit before the code build step.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - Checkmate tool with SonarQube Scanner Plugin analyzes the code.
   - Analysis results are published as reports on the SonarQube server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

5. **Quality Gates:**
   - The code is evaluated against quality gates criteria on the SonarQube server.

6. **Code Build with Maven:**
   - If the code passes quality gates, Maven builds the code.
   - Dependencies are downloaded from the Nexus server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance during the build process.

7. **Artifact Repository:**
   - The built artifact is sent to the artifact repository on the Nexus server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

8. **Slack Notifications:**
   - Slack notifications are sent at each stage of the continuous integration process.
   - Failure notifications are sent in case of any issues.

9. **Success Notification:**
   - Once the build is successfully completed, a success notification is sent via Slack.
